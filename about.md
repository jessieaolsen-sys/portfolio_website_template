## Background

I am currently a Statistics: Data Science student at Brigham Young University, and  while it may only be my second year of school, I am %100 commited to statistics and graduate in a year. My interest in Stats began junior year of high school. I was trying to decide what path I wanted to pursue in college and kept running into walls. I wanted to study some form of math, but kept getting frustrated with the options my teachers presented to me. However, when I asked my extended family, multiple cousins encouraged my to explore the field of statistics. The following year I took AP Statistics and the rest is history. 

I really love my stats classes and the work I've had the opportunity to do in the field. After starting a data analyst internship this last semester I could not be more excited to dive into the field of data exploration and modeling. I'd love to someday have the opportunity to work for a large coorporation creating models that impact business decisions and markets.

Thus far I've had multiple opportunities to prepare for my career such as my internship with Classic Fun Center, my 3 semesters working as a TA for BYU's intro stats class, my work with a professor to modify the intro stats class, and multiple class projects. Because I've spent so much time working for the intro stat class I have a solid foundation and deep understanding of the basics. I also have developed effective communication skills and specifically know how to explain statistical concepts in a simple and clear way. My internship has additionally helped me develop hard skills outside of those taught in my schooling. I have learned to use Tableau, Excel, and a small amount of SQL as I've tackled Classic Fun Center's data problems and existing systems. This is in addition to using the R data wrangling and linear model skills learned from my courses. Lastly, I've had the chance to collect real data and write analytical reports as part of multiple class projects for the statistics department.
